Notes about compiling

The compiling process is divided into the following 4 steps:
1st - Code and header files (extensions ".c" and ".h") go into the preprocessor
2nd - Intermediary file goes into compiler writing the assembly file
3rd - Assembly file goes into the assembler to write the object file (extension ".o")
4th - The linker joins all the object files, libraries and start/exit codes into the executable program.

In UNIX environment the source files are compiled using GCC library or GNU Compiler Collection.
Use this form:
gcc -o "out_name" -Wall -Werror -pedantic -std=gnu99 "source_file.c"

-o is for speed optimized assembly code.

Debuging through Compiler Errors
1st - Always fix them by order.
2nd - Ignore unfamiliar error messages until all addressed.
3rd -
